# Facebook Friendbot Factory

## App

This subdirectory is intended to host application source & executables for the friendbot-factory.

Presently, there are 2 primary subdirectories:

1. [bash](bash)
2. [python](python)

Each respectively holds source for the corresponding execution environment. In particular, the [bash](bash) directory is responsible primarily for coordinating batch execution of multiple runtime configurations, whereas the [python](python) directory
primarily implements the application logic.
