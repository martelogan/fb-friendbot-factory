# Facebook Friendbot Factory

## Training config

Here, our **[train.sh](../../train.sh)** script will expect a configuration file "_training.config_".

Effectively, this file is simply a key-value specification of the application parameters.

The structure and parameters needed can be derived from "_[training.config.example](training.config.example)_".
