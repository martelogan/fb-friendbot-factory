# Facebook Friendbot Factory

## Deployment config

Here, our **deploy.sh** script will expect a configuration file "**_deployment.config_**".

Effectively, this file is simply a key-value specification of the application parameters.

The structure and parameters needed can be derived from "_deployment.config.example_".
