# Facebook Friendbot Factory

## Facebook Structured

This subdirectory is intended to host the structured facebook archive data
as parsed by the [facebook-chat-archive-parser](https://github.com/ownaginatious/fbchat-archive-parser/). 

Leveraging a particular parser implemented in **[fb\_messages\_parser.py](https://github.com/martelogan/fb-friendbot-factory/blob/master/app/python/fb_messages_parser.py)**, we will further transform this dataset into a trainable conversation history for a particular user - as required for consumption by the chatbot training library of our choice.
