# Facebook Friendbot Factory

## Facebook Structured

This subdirectory is intended to host the parsed facebook conversation data for particular users
as parsed by **[fb\_messages\_parser.py](https://github.com/martelogan/fb-friendbot-factory/blob/master/app/python/fb_messages_parser.py)** into a trainable format for our chatbot training library. 

Note - here - that this directory will often be unecessary as we will instead pass these trainable
conversations directly to the chatbot training library anyways during the execution phase.
