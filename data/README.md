# Facebook Friendbot Factory

## Data

This subdirectory is intended to host the input/ouput data produced & consumed by our friendbot-factory.

By default, there are 3 intended subdirectories:

1. [facebook_unstructured](facebook_unstructured) - default location for our uncompressed facebook archive
2. [facebook_structured](facebook_structured) - default location for structured results as parsed by the facebook-archive-parser tool
3. [facebook_parsed](facebook_parsed) - available (not currently leveraged) subdirectory for results parsed by fb\_messages\_parser.py

Each data stage is detailed further in its own subdirectory.
